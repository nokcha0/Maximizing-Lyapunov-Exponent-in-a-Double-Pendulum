## Introduction
This project explores the chaotic motion of a double pendulum by calculating the Lyapunov exponent, which quantifies the system's unpredictability. The goal is to find the optimal initial angles that yield the highest Lyapunov exponent, indicating the most chaotic behavior.

## Methodology
- **Modeling the Double Pendulum**: Derived equations of motion and simulated them using Eulerâ€™s method.
- **Lyapunov Exponent Calculation**: Simulated two states with a small perturbation to measure trajectory divergence and calculate the Lyapunov exponent.
- **Parameter Optimization**: Identified the initial angles that maximize chaos using a heatmap visualization.
